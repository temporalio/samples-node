To begin development, install Docker:

  {cyan brew cask install docker}
  {cyan open} /Applications/Docker.app
  {cyan brew install docker-compose}

And start Temporal Server:

  {cyan git clone} https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git ~/temporal-server
  {cyan cd} ~/temporal-server
  {cyan docker-compose up}

Make sure you're using Node version 14+:

  {cyan brew install node@16}

Then, in the project directory, using two other shells, run these commands:

  {cyan npm run start.watch}
  {cyan npm run workflow}
