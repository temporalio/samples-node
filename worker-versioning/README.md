# Build ID Based Versioning

This sample illustrates how to use Build ID based versioning to help you appropriately roll out
incompatible and compatible changes to workflow and activity code for the same task queue.

## Description

workflow.

## Running

1. Run a [Temporal service](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/#how-to-use).
2. Run
   ```
