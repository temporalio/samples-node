## Samples

Each directory in this repo is a sample Temporal project built with the [TypeScript SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/introduction/).

- The fastest way to try these out is starting Temporal and running these samples in the browser:
  - Gitpod: [One click to try](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/) (there is a good free tier)
  - [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace) (if your org admin has enabled this) - [90 second video demo](https://youtu.be/FdEQQC9EdfU)
- To run these samples locally, go through the prerequisites listed in our [Getting Started docs](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/introduction#getting-started).
- To scaffold a new project from one of these samples, run:
  ```sh
  npx @temporalio/create@latest my-project-name
  # or npx @temporalio/create@latest my-project-name --sample sample-name
  ```

### Basic

- [**Basic hello world**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world): Simple example of a Workflow Definition and an Activity Definition.
  - Variant: [Basic hello world with mTLS](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world-mtls) shows how to connect to your Temporal Cloud namespace with mTLS authentication.
- [**Pure ES Modules**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/fetch-esm): Configure Temporal with TypeScript and Pure ESM.
- [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world-js): The Hello World sample in JavaScript instead of TypeScript.

### API demos

#### Activity APIs and Design Patterns

- [**Activities Examples**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/activities-examples):
  - `makeHTTPRequest`: Make an external HTTP request in an Activity (using `axios`)
  - `cancellableFetch`: Make a cancellable HTTP request with [`cancellationSignal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.context/#cancellationsignal).
- [**Activity Cancellation and Heartbeating**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/activities-cancellation-heartbeating): Heartbeat progress for long running activities and cancel them.
- [**Dependency Injection**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/activities-dependency-injection): Share dependencies between activities (for example, when you need to initialize a database connection once and then pass it to multiple activities).
- [**Sticky Activities**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/activities-sticky-queues): Dynamically assign task queue names to ensure activities execute sequentially on the same machine (eg for CI/CD, file processing workflows).

#### Workflow APIs

- **Timers**:
  - The [**progress example**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/timer-progress) demonstrates how to use the `sleep` function from `@temporalio/workflow`.
  - [**Timer Examples**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/timer-examples):
    - Send a notification to the customer if their order is taking longer than expected (using a `Promise.race` between the order activity and `sleep`).
    - Create an `UpdatableTimer` that can be slept on, and at the same time, have its duration updated via Signals.
- **Signals and Triggers**:
  - The [**Signals and Queries example**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/signals-queries) demonstrates the usage of Signals, Queries, and Workflow Cancellation.
  - **Async activity completion**: Example of an [**Expense reporting**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/expense) Workflow that communicates with a server API. Shows how to kick off a Workflow and manually complete it at an arbitrarily later date.
- [**Cron Workflows**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/cron-workflows): Schedule a cron job.
- [**Child Workflows**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/child-workflows): Start and control Child Workflows.
- [**Infinite Workflows**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/continue-as-new): Use the `continueAsNew` API for indefinitely long running Workflows.
- [**Search Attributes**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/search-attributes): Set up Search Attributes (an experimental feature for now).

#### Production APIs

- [**Production Build**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/production): Build code in advance for faster Worker startup times.
- [**Debugging**](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/troubleshooting): The [replay-history](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/replay-history) sample shows how to retrieve Workflow Event History and debug it using the `runReplayHistory` Worker API ([video](https://youtu.be/fN5bIL7wc5M)).
- [**Patching**](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/patching/): Patch in new Workflow code when making updates to Workflows that have executions in progress in production.
- [**Logging**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/logging-sinks): Use Sinks to extract data out of Workflows for logging/metrics/tracing purposes.
- [**Instrumentation**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/instrumentation): Use a [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger to get logs out of all SDK components and get metrics and traces out of Rust Core.
- [**Protobufs**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/protobufs): Use [Protobufs](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/data-converters#protobufs).
- [**Custom Payload Converter**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/ejson): Customize data serialization by creating a `PayloadConverter` that uses EJSON to convert Dates, binary, and regexes.

#### Advanced APIs

- Interceptors
  - [**OpenTelemetry**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry): Use the Interceptors feature to add OpenTelemetry metrics reporting to your workflows.
  - [**Query Subscriptions**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/query-subscriptions): Use Redis Streams, Immer, and SDK Interceptors to subscribe to Workflow state.
- [gRPC calls](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/grpc-calls): Make raw gRPC calls for advanced queries not covered by the WorkflowClient API.

### Fullstack Apps

- **DSL Control Flows**:
  - [**YAML DSL Interpreter**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/dsl-interpreter): demonstrates how to make workflows interpret a custom YAML based Domain Specific Language of your design.
  - [**XState Interpreter**](https://github.com/Devessier/temporal-electronic-signature): demonstrates how to write a workflow that interprets XState state charts. Presented at [the November 2021 meetup](https://youtu.be/GpbOkDjpeYU?t=1616).
- **Next.js**:
  - [**One-click e-commerce**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/nextjs-ecommerce-oneclick): Buy an item with one click, and the Workflow will wait 5 seconds to see if the user cancels before it executes the order.
- **GraphQL**:
  - [**Temporal + GraphQL**](https://github.com/vkarpov15/temporal-graphql): Expose Temporal Workflows in an Apollo GraphQL API
- **Example Apps**:
  - Subscription Workflow example: https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/ (useful to compare with other SDKs)

## Contributing

External contributions are very welcome! ü§ó (Big thank you to those who have [already contributed](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/graphs/contributors) üôè)

Before submitting a major PR, please find consensus on it in [Issues](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/issues).

To start, run these commands in the root directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run prepare
npm run bootstrap
```

Prettier and ESLint are run on each commit, but you can also run them manually:

```sh
npm run format
npm run lint
```

### Upgrading the SDK version

```sh
shopt -s extglob
for f in !(monorepo-folders)/package.json; do jq '.dependencies.temporalio = "NEW_VERSION_HERE"' $f | sponge $f; done
jq '.devDependencies."@temporalio/client" = "NEW_VERSION_HERE"' package.json | sponge package.json;
jq '.dependencies."@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry" = "NEW_VERSION_HERE"' interceptors-opentelemetry/package.json | sponge interceptors-opentelemetry/package.json;
for f in monorepo-folders/packages/!(frontend-ui)/package.json; do jq '.dependencies.temporalio = "NEW_VERSION_HERE"' $f | sponge $f; done
```

### Config files

Also on each commit, config files from [`.shared/`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/.shared) are copied into each sample directory, overwriting the sample directory's config files (with a few exceptions listed in [`.scripts/copy-shared-files.mjs`](./.scripts/copy-shared-files.mjs)). So if you're editing config files, you usually want to be editing the versions in `.shared/`.

The [`.post-create`](./.shared/.post-create) file is a [chalk template](https://github.com/chalk/chalk-cli#template-syntax) that is displayed in the command line after someone uses [`npx @temporalio/create`](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/package-initializer). If you're adding a sample that requires different instructions from the default message, then add your sample name to [`POST_CREATE_EXCLUDE`](./.scripts/copy-shared-files.mjs) and your message template to `your-sample/.post-create`.
