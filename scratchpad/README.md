# Scratchpad

This sample demonstrates a minimalistic single-file style that might be useful for quickly sketching out an idea, or for sharing a minimal reproduction of a bug.
Production code should not be arranged like this! See the other samples in this repo for recommended project structure.

### Running this sample

In one terminal:

```
temporal server start-dev
```

In another terminal:

```
npm install temporalio
ts-node scratchpad.ts
```

The following will be printed out:

```
Hello, Temporal!
```
