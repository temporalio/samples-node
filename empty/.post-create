To begin development, install the Temporal CLI:

  Mac: {cyan brew install temporal}
  Other: Download and extract the latest release from https://github.com/temporalio/cli/releases/latest

Start Temporal Server:

  {cyan temporal server start-dev}

Use Node version 16+:

  Mac: {cyan brew install node@16}
  Other: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Then, in the project directory:

  * Add your Activity Definitions to `src/activities.ts`.
  * Add your Workflow Definitions to `src/workflows.ts`.
  * Set your task queue name in `src/shared.ts`.
  * Modify the `src/client.ts` file and replace `YOUR_WORKFLOW` with the name of your Workflow.
  * Optionally, add Activity and Workflow tests to the `src/mocha` directory in files with the extension `.test.ts`.

Then, in the project directory, using two other shells, run these commands:

  {cyan npm run start.watch}
  {cyan npm run workflow}
